**requirments**

*python3
*pip3

**how to use**

python3 rojaker.py

**Note**

* you will be prompted to install the requirments you need when you start the script, I made it where if you don't have the requirments it'll install them for you when you run the rojaker.py script, so you won't have a requirments.txt anymore because that's inconvenient to a unexpericed user using the command-line, so basically no need to do (pip3 install -r requirements.txt) on this script, requirments.txt ain't there anyways
